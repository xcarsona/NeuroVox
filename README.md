## 🧠 Overview
NeuroVox is a research project focused on building **fair, interpretable, and clinically meaningful machine-learning models** that detect depression-related vocal biomarkers from speech. The project prioritizes:

- Explainability through SHAP analysis  
- Bias auditing across demographic groups  
- Low-cost, scalable screening potential  
- Ethical alignment with global mental-health access goals  

This work is being developed as a competition-level research submission for the **Davidson Fellows Scholarship** and future peer-reviewed publication.

## 🎯 Research Question
Can explainable machine-learning models reliably detect depression-related vocal biomarkers while remaining fair and interpretable across demographic groups?

---

## 🔬 Methods Summary
- **Datasets:** DAIC-WOZ (primary), Kaggle mental-health datasets (backup)
- **Audio Features:** MFCCs, spectral contrast, pitch, energy, prosody
- **Text Features:** Sentiment scores, embeddings
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, XGBoost, CNNs, Transformers
- **Explainability:** SHAP, attention visualization
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, F1 score, ROC-AUC, demographic bias audits

---

## 📊 Outputs
- Trained depression-classification models  
- Performance benchmarks and validation metrics  
- SHAP interpretability plots  
- Model fairness audit report  
- Full research manuscript (IMRaD format)
