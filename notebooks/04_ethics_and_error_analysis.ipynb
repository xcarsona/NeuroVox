hit the fan today though and from just about the time that i woke up i have wanted to string myself up from the ceiling someone tell me not to someone tell me not to kill myself\",\n          \"i am so tired and exhausted every single day i am f living with my toxic family my father died when i was but i was not close to him we barely had a relationship he never really cared about kids my earliest memory of my childhood is of him getting angry about some random thing and throwing away the food on the table and then hitting my mother i have seen my mother get beaten up ever since i was a kid she would hit him back while trying to defend herself they would threaten to kill each other during fights kid me would try desperately to loosen my fathers fists clenching my mothers hair but i was just a small kid with no physical strength so i could not do much except beg and cry for them to stop hurting each other this was long agoone day my grandmother fathers side died and i guess something triggered within my dad even tho he was not close to her at all and he lost his shit he started behaving erratically few weeks later we find out through an office colleague of his that my father had been fired from his work we had no idea he used to go to work everyday in the morning turns out he was just pretending through this said colleague we got to know more he had angry outburst at work spouting weird stuff after some more strange incidents not going into details we got an appointment with a psychiatrist and my dad was later diagnosed with schizophrenia this was when the domestic abuse hit its peak he became way more violent i remember one day he broke my mother nose and she started bleeding fast forward to years i have no sense of time really it all seems like a blur now he stopped taking his meds became super submissive barely said anything i realised eventually that he was depressed exhibited all the signs things changed now my mother became the abuser she would tell him to die how useless he was what a burden he was on us she also started hitting him i tried to stop my father did not he would just sit there and let her do it i have an elder brother too but he had gone for college so i was the only one who had to witness all of this all alone with no help this lasted for some time until he actually listened to her he killed himself around a week after my th birthday my mother found his body in the middle of the nighti am glad he is dead at least he does not have to suffer anymore i do not knowbut now years after all of this shit things somehow seem to have worsened if that is even possible i used it believe that once my father was gone from the picture things would be better we could lead a peaceful life oh boy was i wrong my mothers toxicity oozed out i think i have become the replacement of my father everyday it is the same thing i am a useless worthless piece of shit a waste of space how she regrets giving birth to me how i am a crazy person who need help and more manipulation gaslighting mental emotional physical abuse you name it she got it i have and still am faced it all i try my best to do all the chores and not make her angry but it never matters she will find something to mock taunt and insult me i have no place or privacy to cry it is shiti have kept alllll this shit inside of me without a single soul knowing until recently i told me best friend well not everything but i gave a general overview but i keep stopping myself from saying anything about the present times because it is all so intense and i do not think she would be able to handle all this even i cannot everyday is the same i am so fucking exhausted and tired of everything i wish i could kill myself but i have wayy too much hope to do it i truly want to live a happier healthier life because i deserve it i deserve love and care but my god this is difficult years of trauma and i do not see an end to it i wish i would cease to exist why is killing yourself so hard i am dead inside i need help but there is nothing i have no motivation to do anything no purpose in life sometimes i think i might be depressed but then again i am able to get up do my chores i do not know i have also started seeing signs of trauma during arguments and confrontations and it scares me nothing seems to be go right in my life everything is a fucked up mess when will this end p
